Model Selection
Choosing a Model: Select appropriate machine learning algorithms based on the problem type (e.g., regression, classification, clustering).
Baseline Model: Develop a simple model to serve as a benchmark for comparing more complex models.

Model Training
Training Data: Use a subset of the data to train the model, adjusting its parameters to learn from the data.
Validation: Use a separate validation set (or cross-validation techniques) to tune the hyperparameters and select the best model configuration.

Model Evaluation
Testing: Evaluate the model's performance on a separate test set to assess how well it generalizes to unseen data.
Performance Metrics: Use appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score for classification; MSE, RMSE for regression) to measure model performance.

Model Deployment
Deployment: Deploy the model to a production environment where it can make predictions on new data.
Monitoring: Continuously monitor the model for performance and drift over time.
Updates and Maintenance: Regularly update the model with new data or retrain it to maintain accuracy and relevance.
