Pull Feature Extraction Code to this area

Feature selection would belong to the "Data" category, falling under stages 1-4. 
This process is typically considered a part of Data Preprocessing or even Exploratory 
Data Analysis (EDA), where you identify the most relevant features (variables) 
that contribute to the predictive power of the model. Feature selection helps in 
reducing the dimensionality of the data, improving model performance by eliminating 
irrelevant or redundant features, and making the model training process more efficient. 
So, it precedes the model selection, training, and evaluation stages, which are 
categorized under "Models" (5-8).


Context:
A typical machine learning (ML) pipeline consists of several stages, each critical to the development of a robust ML model. These stages encompass everything from data collection and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment. Here's an overview of a standard ML pipeline:

1. Problem Definition
Understanding the Problem: Identify and clearly define the problem you're trying to solve with machine learning.
Goal Setting: Establish what you aim to achieve with the model, including performance metrics and business objectives.
2. Data Collection
Gathering Data: Collect data from various sources such as databases, files, sensors, or online repositories.
Data Storage: Store the collected data in a format and storage system that is accessible and efficient for processing.
3. Data Preprocessing
Data Cleaning: Remove or correct missing, noisy, or inconsistent data.
Data Transformation: Transform data into a suitable format for analysis, including normalization, scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
Feature Engineering: Create new features from the existing data to improve model performance.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Statistical Analysis: Perform statistical tests to understand the data's distribution, variance, and central tendencies.
Visualization: Use plots and charts to discover patterns, trends, and anomalies in the data.
Data Insights: Gain insights that can inform the subsequent steps of model building and feature selection.
5. Model Selection
Choosing a Model: Select appropriate machine learning algorithms based on the problem type (e.g., regression, classification, clustering).
Baseline Model: Develop a simple model to serve as a benchmark for comparing more complex models.
6. Model Training
Training Data: Use a subset of the data to train the model, adjusting its parameters to learn from the data.
Validation: Use a separate validation set (or cross-validation techniques) to tune the hyperparameters and select the best model configuration.
7. Model Evaluation
Testing: Evaluate the model's performance on a separate test set to assess how well it generalizes to unseen data.
Performance Metrics: Use appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score for classification; MSE, RMSE for regression) to measure model performance.
8. Model Deployment
Deployment: Deploy the model to a production environment where it can make predictions on new data.
Monitoring: Continuously monitor the model for performance and drift over time.
Updates and Maintenance: Regularly update the model with new data or retrain it to maintain accuracy and relevance.
9. Feedback Loop
Iterative Improvement: Collect feedback from the model's predictions in the production environment to make iterative improvements to the model and pipeline.
Special Considerations
Ethics and Bias: Throughout the pipeline, it's crucial to consider ethical implications and actively work to prevent and mitigate bias in the data and model.
Data Privacy and Security: Implement measures to ensure data privacy and security, especially when handling sensitive information.
Each stage in the ML pipeline is iterative and may require several rounds of refinement to achieve the desired model performance. A well-constructed ML pipeline not only automates the process of model development but also ensures that the models are reliable, scalable, and maintainable over time.
